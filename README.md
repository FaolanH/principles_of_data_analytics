# principles_of_data_analytics

Contributed by Faol√°n Hamilton

## My submission for the Principles of Data Analytics module 2025

## This project is an analysis on the Iris dataset, investigating different ways the data can be shown and analysed. It also implements different packages and libraries from various sources, showing that even with a relatively simple dataset of 150 rows and 4 columns, it can be displayed in many ways.

#### Machine learning library used to import one format of the dataset, perfomed calculations for certain tasks
#### Used in Task 1, 2, 6, 9

### Numpy: https://numpy.org/doc/
#### - numerical python (numpy) to help with calculations on arrays
#### - Used in Task 3, 6, 8, 9

### Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html
#### - matplotlib visualises data through charts
#### - Used in Task 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

### Seaborn: https://seaborn.pydata.org/
#### - seaborn visualises complicated data through charts
#### - Used in Task 10

## Tasks
