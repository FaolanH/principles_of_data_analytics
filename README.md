# principles_of_data_analytics

Contributed by Faol√°n Hamilton

## My submission for the Principles of Data Analytics module 2025

## This project is an analysis on the Iris dataset, investigating different ways the data can be shown and analysed. It also implements different packages and libraries from various sources, showing that even with a relatively simple dataset of 150 rows and 4 columns, it can be displayed in many ways.

## Tasks

### 10 tasks were assigned as part of this module. These are broken down into further detail below:

### Task 1: Source the Dataset - using the sklearn.datasets module, the iris  dataset was imported and loaded in

#### Relevant Resources to view for Task 1:
#### iris dataset origins: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iris-dataset/
#### Packages: sklearn (see documentation section above for more details)

# 

### Task 2: Explore the Data Structure - the shape of the dataset, first and last five rows, feature names and target classes were investigated in this task

#### Relevant Resources to view for Task 2:
#### Pandas head and tail: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/basics.html#head-and-tail
##### Packages: sklearn, pandas (see documentation section above for more details)

#

### Task 3: Summarise the Data - show the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of each feature in the dataset

#### Relevant Resources to view for Task 3:
#### page 47 of the numpy documentation showing the functions: https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/numpy-user.pdf
##### Packages: pandas, numpy (see documentation section above for more details)

# 

### Task 4: Visualise features - using matplotlib, plot histograms adding appropriate labels and headings to the plot.

#### Relevant Resources to view for Task 4:
#### Matplotlib has a relevant histogram to show all the potential additions: https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html
##### Packages: matplotlib, pandas (see documentation section above for more details)

# 

### Task 5: Investigate Relationships - Create a scatterplot for any two features in the dataset, colour code three different classes

#### Relevant Resources to view for Task 5:
